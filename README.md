# Cosmic-Trader
A space trading game built using Claude 3. This includes creating image prompts, designing the UI and writing the code.

Made using Javascript, HTML and CSS with the font-awesome and bootstrap frameworks.
Images were generated in Ideogram.

The project started as an attempt to build a game in a weekend entirely using AI tools.

I asked Claude 3 for five game ideas that could be made fairly easily and run on a shared webserver using standard front-end tools.

I picked the space trading game. While I can write Javascript and have used HTML and CSS for nearly two decades this was a way to see just what AI could achieve.

I made no tweaks to the code myself, everything was copy-pasted from prompts. I was delayed by constantly coming up against the Claude 3 rate limit but still achieved the desired game in a weekend.
